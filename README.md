# Supervised Learning: Predicting Prison Sentences
Supervised Learning Project - Models applied include: Linear regressors, SVM, Random Forest

This repository contains the process followed in the creation of multiple regression models for use in predicting sentences for crimes commited in Washington D.C. The notebook file includes the data exploration process through model tuning and model comparison.

The project notebook can be accessed by opening the 'Predicting Prison Sentences.ipynb' file. The presentation that summarizes the project can be viewed by opening th 'Project Presentation.pdf' file.

Thank you very much for your time and interest.
